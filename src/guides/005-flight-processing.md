- Minimize errors from data entry
- Sharing via email to family
- Publishing to calendar
  - Copying to shared calendar if desired
- Flighty
  - Can just fwd emails to them
  - Why not use their calendar sync?
    - Might be a viable alternative, but it's third-party and not free
    - I can't create custom formats for event data
    - Will it create one event for multiple travelers? TODO test this
- TripIt
  - Also third-party
