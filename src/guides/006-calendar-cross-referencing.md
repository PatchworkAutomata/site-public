- TODO
  - create separate calendar views using filters for Sofia's school, Elizabeth's work, and our vacations
  - subscribe to those with different colors in our calendar apps
  - move date to another column, and use formula in name for Sofia's type of school day, E's clinic, etc
  - add start and end times for school and work as needed, could even auto-populate from some other table
  - maybe use the lehrburger.family iCloud account to group them together for easy sharing? test this to see if sync is faster than Google Calendar's
